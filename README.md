## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Created with my small understanding of html and css. I was able to learn how to build  a simple solution that I was able to understand about the different ways through which a project is built.


### Continued development

I wish I could be more fluent with all of the different concepts of building a project. Will be continuing to learn more.


### Useful resources

- W3 schools (https://www.w3schools.com)- This helped me for fetching the proper tags and styles. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
